# Adaptive-Huffman-compression-
# Description 
- it was an assigment 
- it is just an alogrithm called adaptive huffman algorithm , it helps to solve the problem of older huffmans (a statstical informations is needed to work) it behaves based on the current data 
-it uses the concept of the non linear data structre trees 
-at the begining each entry in the data has a fixed code then it change during the process
